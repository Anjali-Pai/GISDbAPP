A light-weighted Survey Helper specific for geographical data / ? spatial data. :)

 4. output data in csv file. The saved files are in the public document directory, like /storage/emulated/0/Document/GIS

##Permission

## Note
1. please control the permission on your own, I am so sorry for that. Requiring for permission function will be online later.
I recommend Total Commander - file manager to find and read generated CSV.file as well as manage APP permission.

3. you can use the up/back button in the tool bar now ~
