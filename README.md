#GISDbAPP
##Goal
An android application.
Create tables/forms, Collect data, Visualize data, and Output data.
A light-weighted Survey Helper specific for geographical data / spatial data. :)

##Features
1. Create any types of survey table/form
2. Collected data which can be visualized on the map
3. Re-edit the survey table/form at any time even data have been collected
4. Output data in csv file. The files are saved in the public document directory, like /storage/emulated/0/Document/GIS

##Permission
1. Location permission for GPS
2. Write files in the external storage.

##Note
1. Please control the permission by your own. Requiring for permission function will be online later. I recommend Total Commander - file manager to find and read generated CSV.file as well as manage APP permission.
2. Whitespace is not allowed in any input
3. You can use the up/back button in the tool bar now
