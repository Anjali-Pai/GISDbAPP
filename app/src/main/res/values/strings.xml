        at now, filelist find no files in the storage
        => fix
        03/13/2016
        add new activity for debug testing
        add two methods: create a file and delete a file in the debug activity
        3/17/2016
        almost rebuild the app
        still fail to find the stored files, maybe the database file is not stored or the way to find files is wrong
        == the database is stored, but cant to find it by file list method?
        == both way can create database files, the problem is to find them
        == got the way to find the database in the internal storage, the internal files system is that
        ..../ files = call getFilesDir() can get it
        / database = in this sub directory, the database file is in
        3/18/2016
        finish file system to show stored files in the internal storage
        show the existed database files
        3/19/2016
        in the read activity
        for now, touch to open the database to check
        achieve functions: open the database
        in the database crud activity
        listview and gridview does not support the addView method
        tablelayout support it
        but, it maybe to difficult to handle the onclick event...
        for now use table layout
        in the curd helper class
        show the data successfully
        layout problems
        03/20/2016
        in the crud helper class
        fix layout problem -
        table_row.add(insert_view)
        table.add(table_row)
        may not use setLayoutParams
        for now it works
        successful:
        1. show the data in the table
        2. insert the data into the database
        03/21/2016
        successful display and insert data in the different databases in test
        03/22/2016
        1. registerForContextMenu:
        if i override, etc in one activity class, does it work for other activities?
        == no, we need to re override in new activity
        03/23/2016
        1. actionmode problem:
            when use action in other method class, too many parameters need to care, try to do in the activity directly
        == done, successfully applied contextual menu
        but the ui need to fix
        2. what is MenuInflater
            ==> try to display the data in the menu
        03/25/2016
        1. make ui simple, finish the main mission first
            - cancel contextual menu
        2. big pic
            * project create new db, read db, upgrade db and delete db
            * database create new table, read tables, upgrade tables and delete tables
            * table create new data, read data, upgrade data and delete data
        03/27/2016
        1. CURD operation of data in the table is on the way to finish, need to fix some ui show problems, like async...
        2.
        03/28/2016
        1. finish the create project activity, basically
        2. need to improve the ui
            field name, field type by dropdown list(spinner), type limits...
        03/29/2016
        1. spinner
            get the selected items, into a array, when create a table, get the values ;) = too complicated, use another way
            Spinner mySpinner=(Spinner) findViewById(R.id.your_spinner);
            String text = mySpinner.getSelectedItem().toString();
        2.
        04/04/2016
        0. add the default value in the create table, _id, geolat and geolang
        1. insert data
            find a error, cant add _id automatically
            => fixed, do not set the value key for _id in the insert operation
        2. get the GPS info
        04/06/2016
        ready to map... seems very complicated
        no any process these days, should speed up
        04/08/2016
        1. add api for map on the android
        2. fragments, google map
            1. map in the fragment
        04/09/2016
        study
        read map in the fragment, then read fragment, then read something about commuications in the
        fragments or with activities, dev tells us to use callback
        then read something about callback
            1. callback
            2. observer pattern, event and listener
            3. callback can be implemented in the observer pattern
            4. something about IoC? lol
        04/10/2016
        a long way to add map in the android

        2. add maker in the map
        3. touch map to get the longitude and latitude
        04/11/2016
